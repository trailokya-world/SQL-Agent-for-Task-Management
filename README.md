# 🤖 SQL Agent for Task Management (Agentic AI)

An AI-powered SQL Agent that enables users to manage and interact with a task management database using natural language. Built using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, **Groq LLM**, **SQLDatabaseToolkit**, and **Streamlit**, the application automatically converts user requests into SQL queries, executes them on the database, and returns intelligent, context-aware responses.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. User enters a task-related query in natural language.
2. LangChain Agent interprets the request.
3. SQLDatabaseToolkit selects the appropriate database tool.
4. The LLM generates or validates the SQL query.
5. SQL query is executed on the database.
6. Results are processed and returned in natural language.
7. Conversation history is maintained using LangGraph Memory.
